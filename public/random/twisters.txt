The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick
She sells sea shells by the sea shore
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Betty Botter bought some butter
The seething sea ceaseth and thus the seething sea sufficeth us
Round the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran
The tweetle beetle battle
The pheasant plucker song
Red lolly yellow lolly
A Synonym for cinnamon is a cinnamon synonym
Irish wrist watch
Pad kid poured curd pulled cod
Vlog blog log vlog
The big black bug
Freak flag fly
The big black bug
A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could if a wood chuck could chuck wood. But, if a woodchuck could chuck woodchucks chucking wood, then a woodchuck would chuck woodchucks.
I wish for a wish to wish for a wishing well
Red leather yellow leather
I slit a sheet a sheet I slit upon slitted sheet I sit
A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could if a wood chuck could chuck wood. But, if a woodchuck could chuck woodchucks chucking wood, then a woodchuck would chuck woodchucks.
The red river rose right by the bakers butters
The sixth Stan's so sick
Rubber baby buggy bumpers
Dickle down the pickle and lickle till its sickle
Shut up the shutters and sit in the shop
You know, you need, unique New York
Shut up the shutters and sit in the shop
Real weird rear wheels
The hog hop to the cog and hop to the lock
One smart fellow smart
How much wood can a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood
Zithers slither
Kindly man mainly eating surely mangoes
One black beetle bled only black blood while the other black beetle bled blue
She sits and shines and shines and sits.
